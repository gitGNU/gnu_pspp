We wish to thank current active contributors to PSPP:

* Ben Pfaff wrote the initial program and manual, which comprises the
majority of the current code. Ben continues to contribute and 
most of the core libraries which ensure that PSPP runs with optimal
speed are his work.

* John Darrington wrote the initial version of the graphical user interface,
and many of the statistical procedures.  John also implemented support for
long variable names, PostgreSQL and Gnumeric and made numerous
revisions to other modules.

is also an important contributor to GSL, which is used by PSPP.
