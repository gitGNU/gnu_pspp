/* Information about character encodings. */

/* ISO C defines a set of characters that a C implementation must support at
   runtime, called the C basic execution character set, which consists of the
   following characters:

       A B C D E F G H I J K L M
       N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
       a b c d e f g h i j k l m
       n o p q r s t u v w x y z
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
       ! " # % & ' ( ) * + , - . / :
       ; < = > ? [ \ ] ^ _ { | } ~
       space \a \b \r \n \t \v \f \0

   The following is true of every member of the C basic execution character
   set in all "reasonable" encodings:

       1. Every member of the C basic character set is encoded.

       2. Every member of the C basic character set has the same width in
          bytes, called the "unit width".  Most encodings have a unit width of
          1 byte, but UCS-2 and UTF-16 have a unit width of 2 bytes and UCS-4
          and UTF-32 have a unit width of 4 bytes.

       3. In a stateful encoding, the encoding of members of the C basic
          character set does not vary with shift state.

       4. When a string is read unit-by-unit, a unit that has the encoded value
          of a member of the C basic character set, EXCEPT FOR THE DECIMAL
          DIGITS, always represents that member.  That is, if the encoding has
          multi-unit characters, the units that encode the C basic character
          set are never part of a multi-unit character.

          The exception for decimal digits is due to GB18030, which uses
          decimal digits as part of multi-byte encodings.

   All 8-bit and wider encodings that I have been able to find follow these
   rules.  7-bit and narrower encodings (e.g. UTF-7) do not.  I'm not too
   concerned about that. */
