/* Functions for rendering a series of output items to a series of Cairo
   contexts, with pagination, possibly including headers.

   The intended usage pattern is this:

     * Create an xr_driver with xr_driver_create().  The cairo_t passed in must
       accurately reflect the properties of the output (e.g. for the purpose of
       page size and font selection) but need not be used for rendering.

     * Call xr_driver_next_page() to set up the first real output page's
       cairo_t.  (You can skip this step if the cairo_t passed to
       xr_driver_create() can be used.)

     * Then, for each output_item:

       - Pass the output item to xr_driver_output_item().  As much output as
         fits will be rendered on the current page.

       - Then, as long as xr_driver_need_new_page() returns true, obtain a new
         page for rendering and pass it to xr_driver_next_page().  As much
         output as fits on the new page will be rendered on it.

     * When you're done, destroy the output driver with xr_driver_destroy().

   These functions may also be used for counting pages without actually
   rendering output.  Follow the same steps, except pass NULL as the cairo_t to
   xr_driver_next_page().  (But xr_driver_create() still needs a valid cairo_t
   for page setup.)

   (If the cairo_t that you pass to xr_driver_create() won't remain valid, be
   sure to clear it out one way or another before calling xr_driver_destroy(),
   so that xr_driver_destroy() won't destroy it itself.)
